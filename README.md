# ECS 261 Homework 3

## Due: Friday, February 27, 2026 (11:59pm)

This homework is a problem set. Please see `hw3.pdf` for further instructions.

To submit the homework, please upload your solutions as a PDF (`hw3.pdf`) *and* accompanying code (`hw3.dfy` plus any corresponding helper files) to Gradescope. You are encouraged (but not required) to write your solutions in LaTeX; if you would like to edit `hw3.tex` directly, please remove or comment out the problem statements and include only your solutions. The homework should be typed.

This homework continues with Dafny and its logical foundations (strongest postconditions, weakest preconditions, and Hoare logic). For the Hoare logic question, it will be helpful to see some coverage of Hoare logic which we will cover in class this week.
