# ECS 261 Homework 3: Dafny

## Due date: Friday, May 16

## Getting started

For this homework, you will need to have VSCode
and the Dafny VSCode extension installed.
You should have installed these in HW0.
Please review that HW if you need help with your installation.

This is a programming assignment, similar to HW1. There are a few parts:
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 is about classes and class invariants.
- Part 3 is about writing verified code with loop invariants.

As with HW1-HW2, the assignment will be submitted through Gradescope.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.dfy`, `part2.dfy`, and `part3.dfy`.

## Getting help

If you get stuck, some selected hints are in the file `hints.md`.

I have always found the [Dafny tutorial](https://dafny.org/dafny/OnlineTutorial/guide.html)
and [Dafny cheatsheet](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyCheatsheet.pdf)
to be super helpful.

Beyond these: as always, please continue to ask questions on Piazza and drop by office hours!
